    "### Conclusion \n",
    "\n",
    "Here we have interactive table, where we have grouped data, first grouped by the time where couple start sleeping in separate bads and the second group by the duration of their relationship, and than we get number of people and their relationship status. \n",
    "First we can try to check two most interesting groups, \"1-5 years\" and \"11-15 years\". So, we select from the first grom the \"Within the first 1-5 years of our relationship\" and from the secon select \"1-5 years\". And we get that here we have two people that have beendivorced and one them is separated, to do our conclusion we need to compare this resluts with others.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second group is \"11-15years\", so from the first selection group we can check for each variant \"within 1-5 years\",\"within 6-10 years\", \"within 11-15 years\" and compare the results. \n",
    "When we select within \"1-5 years\", we see that we have also two people that have been divorced, than we select \"within 6-10 years\",we don't have any divorced people here, and than \"within 11-15 years\", here also, we don't have any divorced people. \n",
    "\n",
    "From the selection group \"16-20 years\", and from the first \"Within 1-5 years\", we found out 1 people who have divorced. \n",
    "\n",
    "So we find an interetsing pattern that all relationship duration group, who have started sleeping alone within the first 1-5 years ,have people who have divorced, and all this group don't have any divorced people, when they started to sleep separate later. Also as we can see the higher number of divorced and separated people is in the group of people, whos relationship duration was \"1-5 years\" and they started sleep in separate beds within the first 1-5 years in their relationship.\n",
    "Combine insight that I get in the above graph, that this group overall has the lower number of people who tend to sleeping alone  but among this group the most popular reason in \"1-5 years\" is the Argument or a fight, this conclusion is reasonable.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, even if they have arguemnt or fight maybe it would be better to sleep together in the first 1-5 years in their relationship to not get divorced , because it is ok to have such problem on that level of relationship, looking on the data :)\n",
    "Or, when the couple make a decision of sleeping alone, there is very high probabaility that the reason of sleeping alone in first 1-5 years of their relationship, is the misunderstandings, arguments or a fight. \n"
